* Calc progress is removed from ProgressBackgroundRemote, and is calculated only in TranscodeBackground,

  ProgressBackgroundRemote is getting the progress from FFMpegRemoteServiceBridge normally using a regular get method, since they are in the same process.
  This is saving 50% of progress calculations and file access, since till now every process had to calculate the progress separately.

  setCommand(commandStr);

* New transcoding engine version (1.1.03)
* Bug fixes
* Performance improvements.
* LM upgrade. 
* below armv7 devices will work only with personal or OEM licenses.
* Stopping the transcoding while running cause on 4.3 devices a crash message, this happens because on 4.3, when an activity crash (transcoding engine)
  it will drag all the other activities with it, you can ignore this message.
  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/android-developers/snTPpksX9TU
  Looks like the crash is happening on the 264 module (only when decoding/encoding 264), this 
  still need verification.
  You can see the crash in the android log (native crash), on 4.3 it will also be shown in the UI.
